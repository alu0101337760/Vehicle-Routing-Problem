# Vehicle-Routing-Problem

## Introduction

Vehicle routing problem solved using different heuristics:

-  Greedy
-  Greedy Randomized Adaptative Search Procedure (GRASP)
-  General Variable Neighbourhood Search (GVNS).


## Code description
An OO approach was used since this was a class assignment, and it was one of the requirements.
